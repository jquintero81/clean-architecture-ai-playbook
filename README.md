# Clean Architecture AI Playbook â€” Azure AD B2C Edition

This repository is a **practical guide to migrating legacy projects** (for example, Azure Functions written without patterns, with static classes, etc.) to a **professional hexagonal architecture**, **with the help of artificial intelligence (GitHub Copilot / ChatGPT)**.

The main focus is on **projects that manage identity with Azure AD B2C**, covering:

âœ… Login with and without MFA  
âœ… Pre-registration and registration flows  
âœ… Password change and recovery  
âœ… User modification and deletion  
âœ… Sending OTP via SMTP (TLS)  
âœ… Integration with GraphAPI using Client Secret  
âœ… Integration with the company's internal User Core
