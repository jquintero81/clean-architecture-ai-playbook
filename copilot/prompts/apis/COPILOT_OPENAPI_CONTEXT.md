# Copilot Context for OpenAPI Reviews

- This project follows the OpenAPI 3.0 or 3.1 specification.
- The goal is to maintain consistent, secure, and well-documented APIs.
- Naming conventions must follow RESTful best practices.
- Use nouns for resources, avoid verbs in paths (e.g., `/users` instead of `/getUsers`).
- Responses must include correct HTTP status codes.
- Each endpoint must have examples for requests and responses.
- All parameters and schemas should include descriptions and data types.
- Reuse components (schemas, parameters, responses) where possible.
- Follow security best practices (OAuth2, bearer tokens, etc.).
- Validate consistency between operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for the same resource.
