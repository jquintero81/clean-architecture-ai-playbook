Using the context from `COPILOT_CONTEXT.md`, explain the **password reset** flow.

Include:
1. The XMLs involved and their hierarchy.
2. The orchestration steps that validate the user identity.
3. The REST API or Azure Function call used to change the password.
4. The claims that are updated or reissued.
5. Example cURL requests for validation and password update.
6. Error handling logic (e.g., invalid OTP, weak password, expired token).

If possible, represent the flow as a sequence diagram or a step-by-step bullet list.
