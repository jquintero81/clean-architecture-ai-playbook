Use the `COPILOT_CONTEXT.md` context and focus on Azure Functions referenced by B2C.

Explain the complete behavior of the Function **[name of the function file]**.

Include:
- What triggers it (which XML or step in the policy calls it).
- The input claims or request body.
- The processing logic (e.g., OTP generation, HTML email construction).
- The output claims or response format.
- Example `curl` request/response.
- How the B2C policy uses its response.

If possible, provide a short pseudo-sequence of B2C → Function → ClientsAPI → Response.
